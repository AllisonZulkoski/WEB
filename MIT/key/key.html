        Reflection/Key Takeaways
    </div>
    <div class="middle-text">
        When I read this book, the impact it had on me was major. The book is obviously supposed to be an exaggeration to prove a point, but is it actually an exaggeration currently? I honestly do  not think so. With the current global climate, books are banned nationwide in multiple countries because of their content. Information is becoming more governmental and more about what the government wants you to hear and they censor the rest. Everything, including information, is profitable and can be bought, which is how fake news becomes so prevalent. Polarizing information is most of what we consume. People can sway others if they are in shock at what they are hearing and in a “vulnerable” state to hear it. Takeaways from the book are that people who read (can also be looked at as people who find their own information) are ostracized and exiled by society because that is not the norm. Information-based societies do not exist, they never can when people all have different options, values, and societal morals influencing their daily lives. The life of Millie is a good comparison to mental health: people often feel trapped, depressed, and overall unhappy and do not want to actually do anything about it or they stay in the cycle that creates it (technology).
