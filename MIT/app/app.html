        Fahrenheit 451 was written in 1954, meaning technology was still a new thing, meaning Ray Bradbury had foreshadowed its importance and the effect it would have on society. Currently, everybody has a cell phone, people are found walking around on it, always having headphones in, or using it in some way as a function of normalcy throughout the day. Technology has become the forefront of most things people do, we could not function without it. Even things such as digital news formats are being traded for short-form content because the attention span of people is getting lower and lower. Things like an entire room of screens is not far-fetched. TVs are getting bigger, phones and computers are getting both bigger and smaller at the same time, and wherever you go, you can usually spot some sort of screen. Libraries are less crowded, people who read are a specific “type” of person, and less and less people research their information before they come to a conclusion.
