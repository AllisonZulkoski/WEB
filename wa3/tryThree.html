    <h1>Waffle House Index</h1>
    <p>The <strong>Waffle House Index</strong> is an informal metric used by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to determine the effect of a storm and the likely scale of assistance required for disaster recovery. The term was coined by Craig Fugate, former head of FEMA.</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The index is based on the reputation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle_House">Waffle House</a>, a restaurant chain known for its 24-hour, 365-day-a-year service, to remain open during extreme weather events. If a Waffle House restaurant is closed due to a storm, the situation is considered severe.</p>
    
    <h2>Categories</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Green:</strong> Full menu available, minimal or no damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Limited menu available, power source is an issue (generator in use), or food supplies are low.</li>
        <li><strong>Red:</strong> Waffle House is closed, indicating severe damage or dangerous conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Use in Disaster Response</h2>
    <p>FEMA uses the Waffle House Index as one of several measures to assess disaster impact and allocate resources. Because Waffle House has strong emergency protocols, a closure is a sign of serious damage in an area.</p>
